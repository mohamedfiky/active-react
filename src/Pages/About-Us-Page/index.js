                        It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.
                        That doesn't mean people don't try. Recent advances in Artificial
                        Intelligence have a lot of people predicting what jobs are an are
                        not likely to be replaced by computers. Technology is challenging
                        the ideas about what jobs can and cannot be replaced by technology.
                        Doug Peterson, who shares a lot of interesting articles,
                        recently share this one predicting that leaders will not be replace.
                        It's an optimistic article. 5 Reasons Leaders Shouldn't Worry
                        That Generative A.I. Will Take Their Jobs | Inc.com A lot of
                        jobs we once thought were completely safe are being seen in
                        a new way lately. AIs are creating what looks to many like
                        art for example. This is forcing us to take a hard look
                        at how we define art. Some recent visits to museums had
                        me already asking “what is art?” Today we joke about
                        AI attempts to write short stories, poetry, and other
                        narratives. A lot of our stories in movies an even
                        books are formulaic. How long before AIs can write
                        Hallmark Christmas movies I wonder? What used to
                        be a joke may be a prediction of the future.
                        A lot of people are speculating on  the future end
                        of the programmer profession. People have been
                        predicting that would decades but we are closer
                        to that than ever before. Software developers
                        today think they are safe though because they
                        (we) know that end users are terrible about
                        describing what they want a program to do.
                        Will the future bring courses and training
                        on how to talk to AIs? Possibly.
                        I can sure see the need for it.
